However, this delight is little diluted as the said Bill would prohibit private cryptocurrencies in India.\\\\n\\\\nCreating an official digital currency for India is a good step towards digitization, but I am concerned about the repercussions that India's cryptocurrency market would face if private cryptocurrencies are barred. \\\\n\\\\nIn March 2020, after the honourable Supreme Court of India announced the banking-ban waiver we now have around 10-20 million cryptocurrency users in the country with more than 340 startups providing related services and employing more than 50,000 direct and indirect employees. \\\\n\\\\nIf the Parliament passes this Bill, everybody from the ecosystem will be significantly affected.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, India would be the only large economy to not allow private cryptocurrencies, and would thereby get left behind for years to come in the global space of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.\\\\n\\\\nI am concerned that we might lose out on an excellent opportunity for the development of a new digital India which is self-reliant as well as in line with our Prime Minister's vision for India.\\\\n\\\\nThough I understand the challenges that come with decentralised cryptocurrencies, I am confident that India's Government would find a win-win solution by engaging with the crypto community stakeholders to find progressive solutions.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, I implore your support to call out in the government for positive and progressive cryptocurrencies regulation in India. \\\\n\\\\nWarm Regards\\\",\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThank you for being my representative in the government. I am writing to you because I am discouraged by the Government of India's recent news which states bringing a bill in the Loksabha to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India. \\\\n\\\\nBut I think, prohibiting or banning all private cryptocurrencies, will be a regressive step for India when the rest of the world is embracing them.\\\\n\\\\nIndia's cryptosphere is a thriving ground of:\\\\n\\\\n1. 10-20 million active crypto users\\\\n2. 340+ crypto start-ups offering crypto products and services.\\\\n3. 50,000+ direct and indirect employment or work \\\\n4. Millions of dollars in Venture Capital funding \\\\n\\\\nIf this bill is passed India will be left behind in the crypto and blockchain technology space, and intellectual Indians will be forced to be brain drained from India for conducive regulations.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, crypto users like me and all the crypto start-ups in India acknowledge and empathize with the government on the challenges these decentralized cryptocurrencies pose. But such challenging questions were posed in front of India at the advent of computers and the Internet in India, but the progressive stance of the Indian Government at that time has made India the software and IT superpower it is today.\\\\n\\\\nLastly, I believe that creating a win-win situation of positive regulations will put India on the driving seat in the global blockchain and crypto space. And thereby not only contribute significantly to the Prime Minister's goal and vision of 'self-reliant India' (Atmanirbhar Bharat) but will give birth to a thriving Digital Indian Economy of $5 Trillion by 2024.\\\\n\\\\nThat's why I would ask for your help in advocating for progressive regulation of cryptocurrencies in India to be competitive and at par with countries like the US, China, etc \\\\n\\\\nYour Voter Sincerely\\\",\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThank you for your honest representation of the public in Parliament. \\\\n\\\\nI write to highlight my concerns and suggestions regarding the impending Crypto Bill. I understand that the Government is planning to introduce the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021. \\\\n\\\\nWhile I believe creating and launching an RBI issued digital currency is a step towards embracing Web 3.0 and accelerating the Modi Government's vision of a Digital India and Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India).\\\\n\\\\nI am concerned that the prohibition of private cryptocurrencies might stun the growth of Digital India. With the entire world embracing cryptocurrencies, it would be regressive for India to be deprived of such once in a generation opportunity. \\\\n\\\\nMost importantly, if the proposal to ban cryptocurrencies gets approval in the parliament, it will adversely affect retail investors such as myself who are invested in this new asset class. \\\\n\\\\nThus, I seek a progressive and positive regulation in the crypto space which will work towards the interest of the government and the crypto community together. \\\\n\\\\nAnd so, I humbly ask for your support to appeal to the Parliament and urge it to consider the crypto space's favourable regulations. \\\\n\\\\nThanks and Regards\\\",\\\"\\\\n\\\\nBefore all else, I would like to express my gratitude for your selfless service to your constituency members. \\\\n\\\\nTrusting that you will understand my stance here, I am writing this letter to discuss the recently proposed bill:  Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021.\\\\n\\\\nThrough this bill, I understand that the government intends to create a digital currency while seeking to prohibit private cryptocurrencies with certain exceptions.\\\\n\\\\nWhile the move to create a digital currency looks promising as it truly embraces the concepts of Web 3.0 but, the proposal towards banning private cryptocurrencies might be contrary to the vision of a Digital India.\\\\n\\\\nWith cryptocurrency now at the forefront of becoming a mainstream asset class, the prohibition of its usage may impact a large number of individuals and organisations such as:\\\\n\\\\n1. 20 million citizens who are invested in cryptocurrencies.\\\\n2. 340+ cryptocurrency startups and service providers \\\\n3. 50,000+ direct and indirect employees \\\\n\\\\nI understand the challenges that the government may face with full-scale crypto adoption and I am sure the crypto community also understands this. But, just as India braved through the threats posed by the advent of software and rose strongly in the field. \\\\n\\\\nI am confident that the Government Of India will take the necessary measures to create a win-win situation for everyone involved in crypto, thereby contributing to the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat by 2030.\\\\n\\\\nThus, I request you to look into this matter and represent my opinion in the parliament for positive and progressive regulation of the cryptocurrency market in India.\\\\n\\\\nWarm Regards\\\",\\\"\\\\n\\\\nI want to thank you for your services to society as a public representative in Parliament. I am writing this email to draw your attention to the 'The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021.' \\\\n\\\\nThe said bill expresses the government's intent of launching an RBI issued digital currency while also implying the prohibition of private cryptocurrencies.\\\\n\\\\nThough I am thrilled at the regulatory stance of the government for a digital currency, the expression of prohibiting private cryptocurrencies distresses me. \\\\n\\\\nThe crypto industry in India has experienced a massive boom post the Supreme Court of India announced the crypto ban waiver in March 2020.  Since then, over 20 million Indian citizens have trusted the crypto market by investing in cryptocurrencies. And several crypto startups have been funded by renowned venture capitalists that facilitate such investments. \\\\n\\\\nSuppose this bill is passed, not only 340+ startups will be affected, but 50,000+ direct and indirect employees of such startups and 20 million investors will also be adversely impacted. \\\\n\\\\nI understand the challenges posed by decentralised currencies. However, such challenges are nothing compared to the advent of the internet in our country. As a nation, we took a proactive approach then and are now a software and IT superpower in the world. \\\\n\\\\nI feel that blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies will be an integral part of our journey towards our Prime Minister's vision of self-reliant India' and the dream of achieving a $5 Trillion digital economy by 2024. And for that, a  win-win discussion with the Government to work on a solution that is in the common good of all Indians is the best approach. \\\\n\\\\nOn behalf of all crypto investors, I make a humble request that you consider the interests of all and take a progressive stance towards this bill.\\\\n\\\\nYour Voter Sincerely\\\"]\");//# sourceURL=[module]\n//# sourceMappingURL=data:application/json;charset=utf-8;base64,eyJ2ZXJzaW9uIjozLCJzb3VyY2VzIjpbXSwibmFtZXMiOltdLCJtYXBwaW5ncyI6IiIsImZpbGUiOiIuL2NvbXBvbmVudHMvZW1haWwvbWVzc2FnZXMuanNvbi5qcyIsInNvdXJjZVJvb3QiOiIifQ==\n//# sourceURL=webpack-internal:///./components/email/messages.json\n");
