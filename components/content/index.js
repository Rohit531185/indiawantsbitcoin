              As they say, 'All great changes are preceded by chaos'.
              <br /><br />
              One such chaos, our young but thriving crypto community in India comprising of 10 million+ users, and 300+ crypto start-ups are undergoing because of the impending Crypto ban bill that is on the line to be presented in Loksabha soon.
              <br /><br />
              The most important part of this crypto ecosystem in India is the users of crypto, i.e. YOU. 
              <br /><br />
              We know that you have a burning opinion about this matter, we know you want to do something about this, we know you want to play your part and express your feelings. 
              <br /><br />
              That's where <strong>#IndiaWantsBitcoin</strong> comes into the picture to help you raise your VOICE and reach out to your Member Of Parliament of your constituencies to call for positive and progressive regulation of crypto markets in India instead of a regressive one to create a new Digital India which is in line with Prime Minister's goal of Self-Reliant India (Atmanirbhar Bharat)
              <br /><br />
              So go ahead & send a personal email to your MPs in a couple of clicks to change the future course of cryptocurrencies in India by using this platform which is:
